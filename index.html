    <h3>Welcome to Annette's page!</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Annette, a Librarian at Cypress College. I got my BFA in Photography at Cal State Fullerton in 2004 and my MLIS degree at UCLA in 2009. I am using a 2019 MacBook Pro with a screen that is way too small for this type of work.

        I had a lot of challanges with this assignment and the set-up! I had a lot of human and computer issues... the Catalina update did not help. Many thanks for Michael zooming with me in the evening to help me sort it out! Thank you!
